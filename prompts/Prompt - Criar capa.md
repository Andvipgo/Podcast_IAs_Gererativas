#Crir Capa.

###**Prompt:** 

"Create a portrait-style image featuring a single male character with a confident and engaging posture. The character should remain as in the original reference image, preserving the existing color palette—cool hues such as teals, deep blues, and purples, accented with subtle highlights of white or silver.(Obs: este paragrafo de inicio foi feito com base em uma imagem exitente, a fim de a IA usar cores e estilo semelhantes, mas o personagem deve ser criado do zero, sem copiar a imagem original).

Replace the background with a thematic environment related to *science and data analysis*. This includes abstract visualizations like floating data streams, digital grids, transparent screens with graphs and metrics, circuit patterns, and light particle effects to evoke a sense of modern analytics.

Use **balanced lighting** with soft, diffused glow emanating from the background screens and a gentle rim light on the character to enhance depth. The atmosphere should feel futuristic but professional—no clutter, just high-tech serenity.

Maintain a **studio-quality camera angle**, framed waist-up or mid-body, with slight depth of field to keep the character sharp while the background subtly blurs. The composition should feel dynamic but clean—ideal for branding or professional contexts."

**Image size/resolution:**  
300x300 pixels, square format—ideal for avatars, labels, or profile imagery.

**Mood and tone:**  
Smart, engaging, and innovative. Designed to communicate intelligence, reliability, and a forward-thinking mindset.
